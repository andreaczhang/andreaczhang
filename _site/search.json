I received my MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London in 2016, then started my PhD at Oslo Center for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Norway.\nI have recently (October 2020) joined the Department of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology and Modeling at Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstittutet) as a researcher. My team works on real time surveillance system, Sykdomspulsen.\nOutside work I enjoy traveling and hiking. Due to the ongoing covid pandemic, I started and became an avid player of the Nintendo game: Animal Crossing New Horizon.\nMore about the site\nThis site is the 2nd version (using distill) since I started using R to build websites, the 1st being blogdown. There are two reasons for switching:\nMy old blogdown site used the famous theme academic, yet I found it overly complicated to have a simple layout.\nThe new package distill only offers one theme, yet I could still change the color and fonts (which are enough!) For simplicity, it is time to switch.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nHi! Welcomd to my new website, build in distill.\nI am a researcher at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Modeling, Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstitutte). I mostly work on the development of an open-source health surveillance system, Sykdomspulsen. In addition I maintain and develop several R packages including fhidata, fhimaps, fhiplot.\nIn the meantime I am a PhD student at the Oslo Center for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Norway. My PhD work is focused on Electronic Health Records, generated from hospitals in particular. My current research interest is the use of EHR data for patient transfer tracking and visualisation with networks.\nYou can find me on twitter or github.\n\n\n\n",
