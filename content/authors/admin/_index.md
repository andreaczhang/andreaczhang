I am a researcher at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Modeling, Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstitutte). I mostly work on the development of an open-source health surveillance system, [Sykdomspulsen](https://www.fhi.no/hn/statistikk/sykdomspulsen/sykdomspulsen/). In addition I maintain and develop several R packages including [fhidata](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/fhidata), [fhimaps](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/fhimaps), [fhiplot](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/fhiplot). 

In the meantime I am a PhD student at the Oslo Center for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Norway. My PhD work is focused on Electronic Health Records, generated from hospitals in particular. My current research interest is the use of EHR data for patient transfer tracking and visualisation with networks. 

In my free time I like cooking and my favorites are Sichuan Foods. During the covid19 pandemic my new hobby is the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizon.
